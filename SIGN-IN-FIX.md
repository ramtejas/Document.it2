# Document.it - Sign-in Issue Fixed! âœ…

## ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed

The sign-in button issue was caused by:

1. **Event Handler Timing** - JavaScript was trying to attach event listeners before DOM elements were fully loaded
2. **Form Submission Conflicts** - Multiple event listeners were being attached to the same form
3. **Authentication State Management** - Improper handling of the authentication flow

## âœ… Fixed Issues

- **Form submission properly prevents default browser behavior**
- **Authentication state correctly managed**
